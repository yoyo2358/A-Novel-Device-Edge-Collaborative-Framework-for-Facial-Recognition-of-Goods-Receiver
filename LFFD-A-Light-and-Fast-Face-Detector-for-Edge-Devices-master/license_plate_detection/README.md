## License Plate (LP) Detection
We use the CCPD dataset introduced by paper [Towards End-to-End License Plate Detection and Recognition: A Large Dataset and Baseline](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD).

### Recent Update
* `2019.10.02` model v1 for CCPD dataset is released.
* `2020.03.27` model v1_small for CCPD dataset is released.(half parameters, much faster, much more friendly for edge devices)

### Brief Introduction to Model Version
* v1 - is designed for CCPD dataset, covering LP scale [64, 512]. It has 3 branches. Please check 
`./symbol_farm/symbol_structures.xlsx` for details.
* v1_small - the same as v1 but has less parameters, resulting much faster inference speed. Please
check `./symbol_farm/symbol_64_512_16L_3scales_v1_small.py` for details.

### Inference Latency

* Platform info: NVIDIA RTX 2080TI, CUDA 10.0, CUDNN 7.4.2, TensorRT 5.1.5.0

> CAUTION: The latency may vary even in the same setting.

### Accuracy on CCPD Dataset
We use the latest CCPD dataset, containing 351,974 images (it is larger than the version described in the paper).
**Since the train/test split is not provided by the paper, we randomly select 3/5 data for training and the rest is for test.**
We train v1 on the training set (211,180 images) and evaluate on the test set (140,794 images). 

#### Quantitative Results on Test Set
Average Precision (AP) is used for measuring the accuracy. In detail, we use code [Object-Detection-Metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics)
for calculating the AP metric. The following table presents the results:

> `The comparison is not fair due to different traning/test split. This is for reference only!`
>
> `We make only one inference for each image in test. So some extremely large plates are failed to detect.`
